# Parameters

This page contains topology and parameter files to perform Molecular Dynamics simulations

* 01_PS_PEEK_CNT

    *par_PNC.prm* :  Parameter file to perform Molecular Dynamics simulations of polystyrene,  polyether ether ketone,  and double-walled CNTs.   Force field parameters were adapted from the CGenFF force field. Atom types were renamed to contain only four characters.
    
    *top_PNC.rtf* :  Topology file  to build atomic models of polystyrene and polyether ether ketone polymers.  Residue topologies were adapted from CGenFF force field.
